# Beta programme rules.

By applying to the rules you agree to the following rules:

## Only the person who filled out the google form is allowed access
This means no one can use your account. Only you have access. You understand that the server is a test server however due to limitations with the Roblox API and OAuth2.0 we cannot have any more than 100 users sign in. Only authorised users will be allowed access.
You will have to provided your Roblox ID to us upon siging up to prevent unwanted access however we have to stick to these limits whilst we await approval.

## No sharing links to the online portal
This is highly prohibited. If we catch anyone breaking these rules we will terminate your beta acccount immediately. We do allow sharing of public links however internal links are not allowed.

## Recording / streaming (content creators):
We highly encourage content creators to share your feedback on the beta online on whichever platforms you use. You can show demos of using the app and online portal however you must not share the URL, doing so is highly prohibited. We recommend recording the use of the app and then editing out URL's later

## Can I be removed fromthe beta programme?
Yes!. If you are caught breaking any of the above rules your account will be terminated and you will get a notification by email and by your prefered method of contact.
You can also be banned from the system once it goes public also by misusing our systems. If the infraction is serious you may not get access to the public version and will be limited to an offline account

### Pricing structure:
Content creators may want to inform the community about the pricing structure. This is a project being worked on by captainorigami01 who is taking domations but the rest of the app / portal will be free to use. A donation would be kind form users to keep the portal and online functionality running so people can share routes to friends and devices easily.

During the beta aon online account will be required to access the entire system. Beta will last 40 days. After this all accounts will be disabled and I will be rolling out the changes required to make it publicly accessible. Beta will start once the app is ready. Currently aiming for the end of April but this could be sooner. We want ot make this public by the end of June.
