Route Generator for Stepford County Railway for passengers and drivers

please see our wesbite for details: [https://scr.captain-vc.com](https://scr.captain-vc.com)

The new route generator is nearly ready for beta testing. For those interested we have 4 spaces remaining. Please see the form below in the important notice to apply

Beta testing will commence from the 1st of January to the 29th of January. A Roblox account is required to participate and only 1 account per tester. You can you alt accounts once released to the public due to the fact the roblox OAuth is limited to a finite number of users until it has been approved which we are currently awaiting approval for

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE:

i am cancelling the release of version 0.16 which was due to bring the release of the ability to share routes and fix some HTML bugs with the outputted timetables.
Instead I will be releasing version 1.0 which will bring the above fixes and an entirely new UI to make the app more accessible. This is being worked on in my free time so updates are going ot be less often as a UI will take time to produce.

Want to get early access? Join our beta program. Current space: `Spaces`. [Join today](https://forms.gle/21eoZL6vv3FLcELm9)

If you have any bugs please report them as usual as I will continue to work on these and release patch releases as I see fit. If the bug doesn't make it to a patch it should hopefully be fixed for the initial release of version 1.0


to run our program use the main.py file provided

captainorigami01 and this route generator is not affiliated with SCR in any way

For security reasons we will only store necessary data on our databases when v1.0 is released. I am going to write out a TOS and a privacy policy at some point. We will not store any loin infomration e.g. passwords at all. We will use OAuth2.0 from Roblox's servers as per the image attached. We will only be using your roblox ID to match records in our database.: ![image](https://github.com/captainorigami01/SCR-Route-Generator/assets/86497366/411f0146-af07-43a1-838a-b01cc2b1786f)
